                <h4>Homelessness is everywhere. </h4>
                <p>But unfortunately, Homeless Partners is not. As part of of our program and Pledge Day 2014, we encourage for everyone to get involved and drop off supplies at a shelter. </p>

                <p><b>Don't live in one of the homelesspartners cities?</b> </p>
                <p>You can still make a difference.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Contact your local soup kitchens, shelters, and homeless societies and ask what kind of donations they would like. Most shelters, with little funds to spare, are grateful for the support. Help someone in need. We swear it'll make you feel great.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">Helping others in need</h3>

                <p>The homeless do not have extravagant needs. One of the most pervasive problems they face, especially in winter, is hypothermia. Help them out this winter and donate:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Winter coats
                    <li>Footwear</li>
                    <li>Thermal underwear</li>
                    <li>Warm dry socks</li>
                    <li>Gloves, toques, and scarves. </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Not only will you help keep a homeless person warm, but you may even get some warm fuzzies yourself. It's pretty much a win-win.</p>

                <p>You can also help out by donating food, art supplies, toiletries and books. Check with your local homeless shelter to find out what they need. Your contribution goes a long way. </p>
